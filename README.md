# TTS_for_FiveM
This program is made directly for FiveM players that couldn't speak, because of health issues. Sadly it's not supporting Female Voice for Czech, but can be updated eventually. Please be patient I'm just learning Lua for QB-core and stay tuned for new updates. 

Installation
This script is made to be a very simple. It should work with native TTS of your computer and also work with others. Wasn't tested yet on public server, but I'll be glad for any kind of feedback on my discord @nemluvka_cz_42420. In begining I had in mind use female voice, but sadly for Czech version isn't ms Zuzana no longer available.
1. Extract the files from tts_V1.0.zip into the folder
2. Put the folder in [standalone] folder in your server resources
3. refresh and then ensure [standalone]

Hopefully this will help peoples with mute issue to explore the world of Five :) <3 <3
Wishing you all the best
